    "# 1.  Dealing with large state spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice one major fundamental difference (in terms of the RL components of each) between the cart-pole, lunar lander, chess, and pac-man examples and the various grid-world examples discussed previously: the size of the state-space.  For example\n",
    "\n",
    "- With the chess example: the number of possible configurations of chess pieces on the board is enormous - i.e., the number of states or size of state space - is on the order of $10^{120}$.  That is far larger than the number of atoms in the known universe!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- With the cart-pole example: each of the four descriptors of the environment is continuous (or finely discretized in practice) - thus the number of states is - technically speaking - infinite.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- With the Pac-man example: if we use raw pixels as input then one state is a single frame of the game, and we have as many states as there are ways to legally arrange pixels in the game.  This is an extremely large number.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these cases the (very large) size of the state space presents practical problems.  Why?  Because remember that - practically speaking - in order to learn the $Q$ properly we need to visit a representative sample of states a number of times.(theoretically speaking - we have to be able to cycle through *every possible state* infinitely often).  Again - practically speaking then - even a state space on the order of chess $10^{120}$ is far too large for us to be able to learn a representative $Q$ effectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even more pragmatically, recall from the first notebook in this series that we store the $Q$ function as a matrix of size $N \\times M$, where $N$ and $M$ are the sizes of the state and action spaces respectively.  But the size of $N$ is - for the problems listed above is far too large (or infinite) to store in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum the issue here is that in most RL problems the **size of the state space** makes directly computing and storing the $Q$ function/matrix impossible.  In this section we discuss the crucial role *function approximators* (neural networks, trees, and kernels) play in ameliorating this issue, allowing us to extend the Reinforcement paradigm to problems with infinitely large state spaces."

The $m^{th}$ column of the $Q$ function matrix contains the (current) response of the system to a the $m^{th}$ realized action $alpha_m$ for each and every possible state, and so it is the height of each such column vector that is problematic for many problems."

    "## 1.1  Compactly representing the columns of the $Q$ matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a way to compactly represent *the vertical dimension* of $Q$ when we have a very large (and possibly infinite number) of states.  Instead of trying to compute and record every input/output pair - which is impossible once the input space is too large or infinite - we can try the next best thing: represent each column of $Q$ by a *parameterized function*.  If each parameterized function is chosen wisely this allows us to both\n",

    "\n",
    "To ensure that each of these functions accurately represents the column of relevant data we will insert into the Q-Learning scheme a new step.  After choosing an action, recieving a reward, moving to a new state, and computing an updated $Q$ value for this state/action pair we will regress this value to the corresponding function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that with the original Q-Learning we update a single entry of the matrix at each step as\n",

Because we have no $Q$ matrix of values we call the value on the left hand side $q_{k}$.\n",

In the original case, where we had no function approximators, we simply replaced the entry from the appropriate column of the $Q$ matrix with this value.  The analog here is that we now need to *re-tune* the parameters of the parameterized function taking the place of the appropriate column of $Q$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to do this is to refit the appropriate model to this data point via solving a regularized Least Squares problem.  Letting $j$ denote the index of the maximum acheived on the right hand side of the update above, an unregularized Least Squares would mean finding the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{j}$ that minimize the quantity $(h_{j}(s_k)-q_{k})^{2}$.  However minimizing this alone would overfit our parameters to the single point $q_k$, and we would lose all of the information contained in the previously tuned parameters.  In order to avoid this we can add a simple regularizer that ensures that the new parameters aren't too different from the previous ones: denoting the previous set of parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{j}^{\\text{ prev}}$ we add an appropriate regularizer to the Least Squares\n",

    "Here $\\beta$ is a parameter we can tune to ensure that the new parameters are either very close to the previously calculated parameters (by setting $\\beta$ to a large positive number), or lighten this restriction by setting $\\beta$ low.  Typically this is either set to be a small constant, or increased gradually at each episode of simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the $\\beta$ setting, and the form of $h$, this regularized Least Squares problem has a closed form solution.  Setting the gradient in $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{j}$ above to zero and solving gives the solution\n",
